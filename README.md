> Angular debugging for the confused developer.

---

__This is a work in progress! UI is still on the up-and-up.__

Log invocations to your services _as they happen_. Just add **dbug**
with a script tag before your last angular module:

```html
<script src="bower_components/dbug/dbug.js"></script>
```

### Installation

```sh
bower install ng-dbug --save-dev

# or

npm i ng-dbug --save-dev
```

Log your own services _or_ ng's internal services!
